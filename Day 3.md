## Daily Journal Day 3

<b>1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
</b>

as an artist, I have always loved using color contrast to make the important things pop. 
I think color is vastly underappreciated and not often thought of, but it can really make your design appealing and draw the right attention to it. Color can also make a site easier to navigate.


<b>2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
</b>

a. I know this may sound a little absurd, but comic books are an excellent example of good design. They have a layout that is easy to follow and directs the reader's attention, and they use colors to convey tones/emotions and tell the story.

b. Take a look at sites like Facebook and Google. Both are very simple in design and yet very effective. Both have a white or light gray background, use spacing and shadows (or a light border) instead of harsh lines, and both are very easy to navigate.

Personally I think it's good practice to take a look at different sites and observe what works in the design and what doesn't.



<b>3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?</b>

A fantastic design layout makes a site easier to navigate, is more eye-catching, and is memorable. I believe a good design is what draws people in and keeps them coming back. 

You can convey a whole lot through design alone. You can convey a certain kind of tone and emotion, you can convey professinalism and functionality, and you can use color, shadows, lines, etc. to direct the viewer's eye. Design is very important. It can be the difference between having a bad site and having a good one.
