<b>How do you find answers when you are stuck?</b>

<p>Personally, my way of solving things is to try as many possible solutions that I can come up with. I might end up finding one that works. If that doesn't work, I do my research and/or ask someone for help. There is no shame in asking someone for help.</p>

<p>1. To always make a plan for your code before coding it.
  2. Expect to fail and fail often. Failure is part of the learning and creative processes.
