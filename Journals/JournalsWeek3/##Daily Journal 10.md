<b>What is the purpose of Encapsulation?</b>

<p>Encapsulation can prevent race conditions. Race conditions can alter the result of your code. Encapsulation helps avoid shared mutable states, computes to an interface, and reduces tight coupling.</p>

<b>What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?</b>

<p>An underscore prefix can end up breaking a code and can create dependencies on data structures. If it encounters something new, the code breaks. Underscore prefixes can also make APIs vulnerable to hackers.</p>
