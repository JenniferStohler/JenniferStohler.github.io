<b>What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?</b>

<p>a. An Arrow Function - they are a shorter way of writing functions and do not create their own values.
    
      b. Function Expressions- these particular functions need to be defined before they can be used. They are also not hoisted. They define an anonymous function.
      
      c. Function Declarations are hoisted and define a named function. </p>

<b>What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?</b>

<p>The difference between a parameter and an argument is that parameters are the names within the function definition and are surrounded by parentheses and separated by a comma. Arguments are the values in the parentheses of a function and are given by the parameters. </p>

<b>What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?</b>

<p>Higher order functions are when a function accepts another function as a parametr or when it returns a function. Array.prototype.map is one example of a higher order function.</p>
